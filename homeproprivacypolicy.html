    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p> 
        This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on Overcast’s website and our apps for iPhone and any other devices and platforms.
            
    <h3>Information we collect</h3>
            
    <p>   When creating an account, you will be asked to enter an optional email address and a password. Email addresses are only used for logging in, password resets, responding to emails that you initiate,
        and notifications that you request. We don’t send promotional emails.
          You may choose not to provide an email address and have an anonymous sync account instead.
        We store information about your podcasts, episodes, and listening progress to sync this information between the website and your devices. We also collect anonymous statistics 
        about which podcasts are most popular to help inform our recommendation engine.
    <h3>Technical basics</h3>
            If you enable notifications, we must store a token to send them. We never use notifications for marketing.
            If you upload files to Overcast, we need to store them until you delete them. 
            If you subscribe to a password-protected podcast, we need to store the credentials you provide in order to keep it updated.
            We use cookies on the site and similar tokens in the app to keep you logged in. Our server software may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs.
            
    <h3>Ads and analytics</h3>
            
            Overcast’s app collects aggregate, anonymous statistics, such as the percentage of users who use particular features, to improve the app.
            No personal data is used to target Overcast’s ads except the categories of podcasts that you’re subscribed to, such as “Technology” or “Business”. Each ad collects, and shares with its advertiser, only three numbers: total views, total taps, and total subscriptions from the ad.
            
    <h3>Information usage</h3>
            
            We use the information we collect to operate and improve our website, apps, and customer support.
            We do not share personal information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to accomplish Overcast’s functionality. We may share anonymous, aggregate statistics with outside parties, such as how many people listen to a particular podcast with Overcast.
            We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.
            In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.
            
    <h3>Security</h3>
            
            We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure. For instance, all communication with the app and website requires HTTPS with certificate pinning. Passwords are hashed, not stored, using industry-standard methods (currently bcrypt).
            
    <h3>Accessing, changing, or deleting your information</h3>
            
            You may access or change your information or delete your account from the Overcast iOS app.
            
            Deleted information may be kept in backups for up to 90 days. Backups are encrypted and are only accessed if needed for disaster recovery.
            
    <h3>Third-party links and content</h3>
            
            Overcast displays links and content from third-party podcast feeds and sites, and downloads podcast files directly from each podcast’s third-party servers. These have their own independent privacy policies, and we have no responsibility or liability for their content or activities.
